## Amsel :bird:
This project is dedicated to develop a preferably cheap robot for freshmen students to teach them basic coding. Main focus is to learn the python in a way as easy as possible without whitewash the fundamental structures of programming.

### Getting Stated
Check the [official documentation page](https://moritzgvt.github.io/amsel/) for further information.

### Library supported
Get [amselpy](https://github.com/moritzgvt/amselpy) library, then:
``` python
# import library
from amselpy import Amsel

# create instance
amsel = Amsel()

# set request adress
amsel.use("192.168.0.100")

# control movements
amsel.forward()
amsel.sleep(5)
amsel.stop()
```

### Onboard API
Use `http://amsel.local/` as an endpoint to fetch data or trigger functionality.

### Additional Information
This code is a result of the course "Roboter Didaktik" at University of Media Stuttgart.
