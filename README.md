# Amsel :bird:
This project is dedicated to develop a preferably cheap robot for freshmen students to teach them basic coding. Main focus is to learn the python in a way as easy as possible without whitewash the fundamental structures of programming.

## Prerequisites
### Hardware
- WEMOS D1 R1 (ESP8266)

### Software
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or other flashing technique 

### Libraries
- ArduinoHttpClient v0.4.0
– ESP8266WiFi
- ESP8266WebServer

## Get started
1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/moritzgvt/amsel.git`
1. [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software): Install ESP8266 in Board Manager
1. [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software): Choose your board, baud-rate (115200) and capacity (4M – 1M SPIFFS)
1. Upload the code to you Board
1. Upload the data folder with SPIFFS

## Additional Information
This Project is a result of the course "Roboter Didaktik" at University of Media Stuttgart
